This project was building an "Employee Summary" website with CLI.  The user types in information about managers, engineers, and/or interns at their company, and it automatically generates the html for a page.

Most of the code was provided with the homework assets, and in the spirit of working harder instead of smarter, I put nearly all of the items in the same directory.  I made it work, regardless.

One of the items that was not included was the CSS.  I generated the following:
